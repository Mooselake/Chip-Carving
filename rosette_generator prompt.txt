Act as an expert web developer and CNC enthusiast. Create a single-file HTML/JavaScript tool titled "Swirl Rosette Generator".

The tool should generate a specific twirl style chip carving rosette pattern for CNC V-Carving.

### Functional Requirements:
1.  **Inputs:**
    * **Diameter (mm):** Overall size of the rosette (default 25mm).
    * **Gap (mm):** The safety "land" or uncut space between all elements (default 0.1mm).
    * **Number of Segments:** The count of petals/borders (minimum 6).
    * **V-Bit Angle:** Used to calculate cut depth (e.g., 60 degrees).
    * **Reverse Twirl:** A checkbox to flip the direction of the petal swirl.
2.  **Outputs:**
    * A live SVG preview of the rosette.
    * A "Save SVG" button that downloads the file.
    * **Important:** The SVG file must use explicit "mm" units in the header (e.g., `width="25mm" height="25mm"`) to ensure correct scaling when imported into software like Vectric V-Carve or Inkscape.
    * Real-time statistics displaying the maximum petal width and the calculated cut depth for the selected V-Bit.
3.  **Geometry Specifications (Crucial):**
    * **General:** All arcs used in the design must share the same radius as the outer circle (Radius = Diameter / 2).
    * **The Border:**
        * Must be a series of closed "Lens" or "Football" shapes arranged on the rim.
        * The width of a lens is determined by the sector circumference minus the configured Gap.
        * The outer arc of the lens follows the circle rim (Convex).
        * The inner arc of the lens curves inward (Concave).
        * The result must be a closed path.
    * **The Petals:**
        * Must be "Pinwheel" or "Swirl" style petals nested inside the border.
        * The sides of the petals are formed by arcs starting from the center (Swirl effect).
        * The top (cap) of the petal must be a Concave arc that runs parallel to the inner curve of the Border Lens.
        * **Clearance:** The petal must be shortened radially so that its tip is separated from the Border Lens by the configured Gap distance.
    * **Separation:** Every shape (Border and Petal) must be an independent closed vector, separated from neighbors and each other by the configured Gap.

### UI/UX:
* Clean, modern sidebar layout for controls.
* Responsive canvas area.
